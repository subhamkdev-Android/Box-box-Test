# 🏎️ BoxBox F1 Companion App (Job Assignment Project)

**A beautifully designed Formula 1 companion app built using Jetpack Compose (Kotlin) and modern Android architecture.**  
This project demonstrates clean UI/UX, structured code organization, real-time updates, and smooth Compose animations — all inspired by a Figma design system.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **BoxBox F1 App** provides an interactive way to explore Formula 1 race information, track stats, top drivers, and circuit details — all presented with a sleek, modern interface.

The app was designed and implemented as part of a **mobile developer job assignment** to showcase advanced Compose skills, UI fidelity to Figma, and efficient Kotlin development practices.

## 🎨 Design & Assets

- ✏️ **Figma-based UI**: All layouts faithfully match the provided Figma design, including typography, spacing, and color palette.  
- 🧩 **Vector Icons (SVG)**: The majority of icons (home, globe, trophy, calendar, etc.) are implemented as **SVG drawables** for crisp rendering and scalability across all screen densities.
- 🌈 **Custom Gradients & Typography**: Consistent use of Space Grotesk and Montserrat fonts, with attention to typographic hierarchy and spacing.
- 🧠 **Dynamic States**: Subtle color transitions, live countdowns, and visual cues to replicate a high-end F1-inspired interface.
